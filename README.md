# Arduino-Car-Bot with Object Avoidance and Shadow Detection

## Overview
This project is a car bot that avoids obstacles and searches for shadows.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Motor driver
- Ultrasonic distance sensor
- Light sensor 
- Chassis, wheels, and motors for the car bot
- Battery or power supply

## Functionality
1. **Object Avoidance**:
   - The car bot uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to detect obstacles in its path.
   - It calculates the distance to the nearest object, stops and changes direction to avoid collisions.
   
2. **Shadow Detection**:
   - The light sensor is used to detect shadows.
   - When the car bot detects a shadow, it stops.

3. **Movement Control**:
   - Two DC motors drive the car bot's wheels.

## Usage
1. Upload the Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Power the car bot with an appropriate power source.
3. Place the bot in an environment where it can move freely.
